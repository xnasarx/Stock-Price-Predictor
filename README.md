# Stock-Price-Predictor
Scarping, parsing, yfinance, and visualisation using plotly
I have used beautiful soup for scarping a data from a website you can use any website. After that for parsing the data I have given it some names and saved it into a txt file after that I have picked some stocks like Amazon and google and displayed there time series graphs. Now for visualisation I have used Plotly to make candlesticks charts which a moving average which will tell me whether to buy a stock or not.
